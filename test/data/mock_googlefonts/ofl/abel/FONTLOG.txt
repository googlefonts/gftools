FONTLOG for the Abel fonts

This file provides detailed information on the Abel Font Software.
This information should be distributed along with the Abel fonts
and any derivative works.

Basic Font Information

Abel is a modern interpretation of the condensed flat-sided 
sans serif. Originally used for newspaper headlines and posters, 
this style can also be used for text on the web. Its angled 
terminals and spiked stems give it enough style to be unique 
at display sizes, while its mono-weight still works well at 
smaller text sizes.
