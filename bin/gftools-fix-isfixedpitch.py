It is important for monospaced fonts to have the 'isFixedPitch' flag set to 1
in the post table. If it is set to 0, Windows coding programs categorize them
as proportional fonts, and they will not appear as options in font selection 
preferences.
\n
This script checks whether a font or collection of fonts appears to be monospaced 
by checking for equal widths in the entire Latin lowercase, a to z. If these are 
equal, 'isFixedPitch' will be set to 1. If a-z are unequal, 'isFixedPitch' will be 
set to 0.

Usage:

gftools-fix-isfixedpitch --fonts [font1.ttf font2.ttf ...]
