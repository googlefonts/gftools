# Google Fonts Tools

This project contains tools used for working with the Google Fonts collection, plus **Google Fonts Glyph Set Documentation** in the [/encodings](https://github.com/googlefonts/gftools/tree/main/Lib/gftools/encodings) subdirectory. While these tools are primarily intended for contributors to the Google Fonts project, anyone who works with fonts could find them useful.

The tools and files under this directory are available under the Apache License v2.0, for details see [LICENSE](LICENSE)

## Google Fonts Official Glyph Sets

The glyph sets useful for type designers that were previously hosted in this repository have been moved to:

<https://github.com/googlefonts/glyphsets/tree/main/GF_glyphsets>

## Tool Usage Examples

Compare fonts:

    gftools compare-font font1.ttf font2.ttf

Add a METADATA.pb to a family directory

    gftools add-font ../ofl/newfamily

Sanity check a family directory:

    gftools sanity-check --repair_script=/tmp/fix.py ../ofl/josefinsans
    gftools sanity-check --repair_script=/tmp/fix.py --fix_type=fsSelection ../ufl

Check a font family against the same family hosted on Google Fonts:

    gftools qa [fonts.ttf] -gfb -a -o qa

Check a variable font family against the same family as static fonts:

    gftools qa -f [vf_fonts] -fb [static_fonts] --diffenator --diffbrowsers -o ~/path/out

Fix a non hinted font

    gftools fix-nonhinting font_in.ttf font_out.ttf

Package and PR a family update to google/fonts. Much more detailed [documentation](./docs/gftools-packager).

    gftools packager "Family Sans" path/to/local/google/fonts -py

## Tool Installation


**Please note that gftools requires [Python 3.7](http://www.python.org/download/) or later.**

Please install these tools using pip:

    pip install gftools

If you would like to use `gftools qa`:

    brew install pkg-config # needed for interpolation checks
    pip install 'gftools[qa]'


### Tool Requirements and Dependencies

`gftools packager` needs the command line `git` program in a version >= Git 2.5 (Q2 2015) in order to perform a shallow clone (`--depth 1`) of the font upstream repository and branch. This is not supported by pygit2/libgit2 yet.

`gftools manage-traffic-jam` requires two private files which contain sensitive data. Ask m4rc1e for them.

### Google Fonts API Key

In order to use the scripts **gftools qa** and **gftools family-html-snippet**, you will need to generate a Google Fonts api key, https://developers.google.com/fonts/. You will then need to create a new text file located on your system at `~/.gf-api-key` (where ~ is your home directory), which contains the following:

```
[Credentials]
key = your-newly-generated-googlefonts-api-key

```

## Developers

### Releasing a New Version

0. Commit and push your final changes for the new version.
1. Create an annotated Git tag of the version number, with a prepended "v", like so: `git tag -a v3.1.1`
2. Write the release notes into the tag message. They will show up as release notes on the release page in GitHub.
