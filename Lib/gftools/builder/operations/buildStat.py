    # OK, buildSTAT is a bit of a tricky one because of how gftools-gen-stat
    # works, and because of how we're likely to want to use it.
    # gftools-gen-stat is intrinsically in-place, although it can be used to
    # write files to a separate directory. The issue is that while we normally
    # want to run buildSTAT right at the end of the process, in which case
    # in-place is OK and we have a stamp file as the target, we might also want
    # to add a STAT table before doing other stuff to the font; in that case,
    # having a stamp file as a target causes problems for future steps.
    # To finesse the problem, we allow for only two cases: either this is a
    # postprocess step in which case it can affect multiple inputs, or it's an
    # "operation", in which case it may only have a single input.
